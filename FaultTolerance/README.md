### Introduction
Definition: Exception handling is a mechanism that allows two separately developed program components to communicate when a program anomaly is encountered during the execution of the program. <br>

Unforeseen situations might occur:
1. Internal
2. External

A robust program should be able to handle all kinds of circumstances, foreseen or unforeseen, whether they are coming from the exterior or are a result of its own faults. 

Exception is a Data Structure, when we throw excep we throw an object, and what's its code: it is the error type.
Type means:
1. Error code.
2. String showing what caused exception.

Exceptions are processed by Exception Handling Mechanism.
